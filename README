# Dockerfile for Liquid Feedback

This is a Fork from [gellweiler](https://github.com/gellweiler/liquid-feedback-docker), which is a fork of [altLab](https://github.com/altLab/liquid-feedback-docker).
I have updated everything for version 3.2.2, fixed not working stuff and refactored everything for docker-compose / external db usage / configured mailing.
I intend to maintain this repo and work on a version 4.0.0 build.

[Liquid Feedback](http://liquidfeedback.org) is an open-source software, powering internet platforms for proposition development and decision making.

The project's source code has a lot of dependencies and requires a lot of tedious steps to build. This Dockerfile simplifies this process and allows interested developers and organizations to quickly build and run a Liquid Feedback server using a [Docker](http://docker.io) container.

## How to use

To build an image go to the Dockerfile dir and do:

    docker build -t darkgigabyte/liquid-feedback-docker .
    
To run the server edit the environment variables in docker-compose.yml and do:

    docker-compose up -d
    
And connect a browser to http://localhost:8080 and login with user admin and empty password
